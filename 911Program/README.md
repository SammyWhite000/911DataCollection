# 911DataCollection
Create a table or chart of the probability a First Responder Vehicle will go past my window during any hour

Seemingly Everyday First Responder Vehicles(FRV) fly past my window. Curiously, I wondered how frequently I actually
See these vehicles. This program will save data each time a vehicle passes by my window. Later this data can
be used to determine the probabilty of a FRV passing by my window during any given hour. 

Fueled by my own curriosity, I want to also know the average amount a FRV passes by each day.

//TODO: Edit this to make more sense when I am not so tired

Data Collection will be written in Java and will be executable using bash command. This will make it easy
to quickly type into a terminal when something goes by and automatically save it for later data use.


//TODO: Make this look nicer with a heading and everything and add more detail once I have figured this out more 

Files:

Two Main files:

Time.Java and Graph.Java

Time.Java will add times and other details to a text file, will be sorta like a "database"

Graph.Java will Calculate probabilities of seeing a FRV during any given hour.
